This package creates embeds and buttons in a very simple way using the [whatsapp-web.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatsapp-web.js) module for whatsapp.

> NOTE : Internally [whatsapp-web.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatsapp-web.js) is being used to send and receive messages. Though it has been safe as per my testing, I cannot promise that your number will not be blocked by Whatsapp. Also, this project is not affiliated, associated, authorized or endorsed with Whatsapp or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in any way.

      .setDescription(
        "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
      )
      .setFooter("Footer")
      .setTimestamp();

    let button1 = new MessageButton().setCustomId("id_1").setLabel("Label");

    let button2 = new MessageButton().setCustomId("id_2").setLabel("Label");

    await send({
      client: client,
      number: from,
      embed: embed,
      button: [button1, button2],
    });
